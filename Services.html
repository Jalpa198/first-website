    <h4><b>Rain Alaam Project</b></h4>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="text">
        <p> Rain Alarm Project is a simple but very useful project that detects Rain (Rain Water) and automatically
          triggers an alarm or buzzer.Water is a basic need in every oneâ€™s life. Saving water and proper usage of water
          is very important. Here is an easy project which will give the alarm when there is rain, so that we can make
          some actions for rain water harvesting and also save the rain water for using it later.
          With the help of saving this rain water through rain water harvesting, we can increase the levels of
          underground water by using underwater recharge technique.

    <h4><b>Traffic Light Project</b></h4>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="text">
        <p>While making a functional PCB with LEDs and resistors is very easy I wanted my traffic lights to look as
          realistic as possible. Unfortunately I don't own a 3D printer so I had to improvise. I decided to use SMT
          components so the traffic light can be small. 1206 is the size which I can still easily solder with regular
          soldering iron and with my eyes (with help of magnifying glass).
          The enclosure of the lights was made from transparent PE film for laser printers. The light from LED is
          dispersed with white packing EPE foam sheet, which is inserted as a layer between the transparent film and the
          PCB with LEDs.There are three types of traffic lights in this project (all patterns are based on real life
          version of traffic lights used in my country - Slovakia):1. Main traffic light with pattern for two traffic
          lanes (left and forward+right) plus one pedestrian crossing orange warning signal for cars turning right.
          Contains 7 LEDs. There are 4 pieces of this light, one for each intersection direction.

    <h4><b>Heartbeat Sensor using Arduino (Heart Rate Monitor) project</b></h4>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="text">
        <p>Heartbeat Sensor is an electronic device that is used to measure the heart rate i.e. speed of the heartbeat.
          Monitoring body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure are the basic things that we do in order to keep us
          healthy.
          In order to measure the body temperature, we use thermometers and a sphygmomanometer to monitor the Arterial
          Pressure or Blood Pressure.Heart Rate can be monitored in two ways: one way is to manually check the pulse
          either at wrists or neck and the other way is to use a Heartbeat Sensor.
